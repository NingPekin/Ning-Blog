I am a skilled DevOps experience on multi-cloud based infrastructure and PAAS deployment. I am a quick learner in tech and a life adventure :)

Graduated from Computer Science DEC degree in Montreal, I started my career as an automation developer. Due to the strong interested in Devops and cloud technology, I jumped into DevOps field for 2 years already.

I am familiar with mutiple cloud provider such as Azure, AWS and Alicloud. With hands on experience in docker and kubernetes, I always want to put everything into the container. At my current job, I am working with Terraform, Gitlab and AWS, so I would like to share some experiences and challenges about them.

I like to draw diagrams and take notes at work to make my mind clearer and overcome my short-term memory :-) Thus, I started to document things I learned and hope to help others.

In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor activites and also indoor cooking exercises. If you ask, I am more a dog person.

Feel free to connect me at Github or LinkedIn to share your bright ideas!
